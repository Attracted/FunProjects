# FunProjects
Projects (Games and Tools) I made in my spare time "just for fun".

Completed/usable projects (bugs aside):

- BombScout (Minesweeper)
- ConnectThemselves (Connect Four with autoplay options and AI)
- CountTheDays (commandline tool which does some wage calculations)
- CreateClabbersTiles (creates bitmap files (tiles) for the Clabbers game. Has inline setup)
- EmailSpammer (WinForm that sends emails through SMTP host)
- GetConsoleUnicodeCharacters (finds commandline symbols for your font)
- IsogramFinder (finds isograms in a .txt list of words. Need to add filename inline.)
- JumpMan (bad Turmac Roll)
- KeyboardHero (very buggy DDR)
- LocalClabbers (LAN Scrabble)
- MEW3 (PacMan)
- MazeRunner (updated MEW3)
- RandomGame (game where you pick a direction (w.a.s.d.) and try not to get the same as the "AI")
- SimpleMtgSim (tool used to randomize and manipulate a list of names physically)
- Slither (Snake with mines -- needs to not spawn mines in front of you)
- SpinIt (not a game, bitmap rotation test)
- TechnoTennis (Pong against yourself -- doesn't have scoring)
- TwinCars (Two Cars on App Store)
- WordFinder (prints results to MessageBox instead of text file)

Uncompleted projects:
- Clabbers (Scrabble, in the middle of adding AI)
- DungeonCrawler (most of the background work is done, need to write gameplay)
- TextAdventure (infant DungeonCrawler)

> ProjectResourcesAndExecutables folder has some of the bitmaps and executables of the working games above
